## My process

### Built with

-   Semantic HTML5 markup
-   CSS custom properties
-   Flexbox
-   CSS Grid
-   Mobile-first workflow
-   Sass

### What I learned

This was a good refresher project for me after taking some time away from frontend development. I found a couple of elements a bit tricky to remember, but they came back to me after awhile.

### Continued development

I struggled a fair bit with the patterns within the hero. I found that using the `::before` and `::after` pseudo-elements helped to position the left pattern (`::before`) and the right pattern (`::after`). I probably failed on this and it is something that I should be focusing my learning as I do struggle a bit with patterns in most of the Frontend Mentor challenges.
